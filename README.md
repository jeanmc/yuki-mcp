# yuki-mcp

A [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) (MCP) server that connects AI agents to [Yuki](https://www.yukiworks.nl) accounting via Yuki's SOAP API.

Built with Node.js, TypeScript, and [`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk).

---

## Installation

```bash
npm install @codemill-solutions/yuki-mcp
```

Then add it to your MCP host configuration (e.g. `claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "yuki": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["node_modules/@codemill-solutions/yuki-mcp/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "YUKI_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here",
        "YUKI_DOMAIN_ID": "your-administration-guid-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- A Yuki account with API access enabled
- Your Yuki API key (Yuki → Settings → API)

---

## Setup

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure environment variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env`:

```env
YUKI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
YUKI_DOMAIN_ID=your-administration-guid-here  # optional at startup
```

`YUKI_DOMAIN_ID` can be left empty — the server starts without it. Call `get_administrations` to discover the correct GUID, then pass it via the `administrationId` parameter on individual tools.

### 3. Build

```bash
npm run build
```

### 4. Connect to an MCP host

Add to your MCP host configuration (e.g. `claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "yuki": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/yuki-mcp/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "YUKI_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here",
        "YUKI_DOMAIN_ID": "your-administration-guid-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Multi-administration support

If you manage **multiple Yuki administrations** (each with its own API key), you can supply a JSON file that maps every `administrationId` to its corresponding API key. The server then authenticates per administration automatically — no single shared key required.

### Keys file format

```json
{
  "a1b2c3d4-0000-0000-0000-000000000001": "api-key-for-admin-1",
  "a1b2c3d4-0000-0000-0000-000000000002": "api-key-for-admin-2"
}
```

### Path resolution (first match wins)

| Priority | Path |
|----------|------|
| 1 | `YUKI_API_KEYS_FILE` environment variable (explicit path) |
| 2 | `~/.yuki/api-keys.json` (default user-level location) |
| 3 | `./api-keys.json` (local fallback for development) |

### Environment variable

```env
YUKI_API_KEYS_FILE=/path/to/your/api-keys.json
```

When a keys file is present, `YUKI_API_KEY` becomes optional — the file keys are used for all administration-specific tool calls, and `YUKI_API_KEY` (if set) serves as the fallback for tools that don't target a specific administration (e.g. `get_administrations`).

If neither `YUKI_API_KEY` nor a keys file is found at startup, the server logs a warning but continues running — tools will return an error when called.

### Reloading keys at runtime

When a new key is generated externally — for example by a sibling MCP server that drives the Yuki Integraties UI to create a fresh API key for a new administration — the new entry only lands in `~/.yuki/api-keys.json`. By default the MCP server reads that file once at startup, so a freshly added key would require a server restart before it can be used for SOAP calls.

The **`reload_keys`** tool (see [Available tools](#available-tools-31) below) avoids this: it re-reads the keys file from disk and replaces the in-memory map in place. Sessions for keys that **changed** or were **removed** are evicted from the session cache automatically; sessions for unchanged keys stay warm so subsequent calls do not pay the re-authentication cost.

Typical flow for a sibling tool that has just minted a new key:

```
1. (external) write the new key to ~/.yuki/api-keys.json
2. yuki-mcp.reload_keys()        → { added: [<adminId>], updated: [], removed: [], total: N }
3. yuki-mcp.get_administrations  → now works for the new admin without restart
```

## Available tools (31)

### Administrations

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `get_administrations` | List all administrations (companies) for this API key. **Run this first** to find the correct `administrationId`. |
| `get_administration_id` | Look up an administration's GUID by its exact name. Useful when you know the name but not the GUID. |
| `reload_keys` | Re-read the `administrationId → apiKey` JSON file from disk without restarting the server. Returns a diff of added/updated/removed IDs and invalidates affected sessions. Use after an external `create_api_key` flow. |

### Relations

| Tool | Key parameters | Description |
|------|----------------|-------------|
| `search_relations` | `searchValue`, `searchOption?`, `active?`, `pageNumber?` | Search customers and suppliers by name, code, VAT number, email, etc. Returns up to 100 results per page. |
| `upsert_contact` | `fullName`, `contactCode?`, `contactType?`, … | Create or update a contact. When `contactCode` matches an existing record it is updated; otherwise a new contact is created. |

| `get_transaction_details` | `reference` | Check if an outstanding item still exists and retrieve its current status. |
| `process_journal` | `subject`, `entries[]` | Post a general journal entry (memoriaal). All entry amounts must sum to exactly 0. Used for bank reconciliation, corrections, and custom bookings. |

### Accounting

| Tool | Key parameters | Description |
|------|----------------|-------------|
| `get_gl_accounts` | `date?` | Retrieve all GL accounts with their balance at a given date (commercial view). Use this to find account codes before calling `get_transactions`. |
| `get_gl_accounts_fiscal` | `date?` | Same as `get_gl_accounts` but including fiscal corrections. Use for balance sheets and P&L views that must match Yuki's fiscal reports. |
| `get_net_revenue` | `startDate`, `endDate`, `fiscal?` | Retrieve net revenue (netto-omzet) for a date range. Set `fiscal=true` to include fiscal corrections. |

### Accounting info

Richer read-only views from the `AccountingInfo.asmx` service — not available through the standard `Accounting.asmx`.

| Tool | Key parameters | Description |
|------|----------------|-------------|
| `get_gl_account_scheme` | — | Retrieve the complete GL account scheme (rekeningschema): all codes with type, subtype, description, and active/inactive status. Use to validate GL codes or build account pickers. |
| `get_period_table` | `yearId` | Retrieve the fiscal period table for a year: period numbers, names, and date ranges. Use to translate transaction dates into human-readable period names for reports. |
| `get_gl_transactions_detailed` | `startDate`, `endDate`, `glAccountCode?`, `financialMode?` | Detailed transaction listing with document type, archive folder, fiscal period ID, project code, and mutation user. More complete than `get_transactions`. Leave `glAccountCode` empty for all accounts. |
| `get_transaction_document` | `transactionId` | Download the source PDF for a booked transaction as base64. Use the `id` or `hID` from `get_gl_transactions_detailed`. |
| `get_start_balances` | `yearId`, `financialMode?` | Retrieve opening balances (beginbalansen) per GL account for a fiscal year. |

### Documents

| Tool | Key parameters | Description |
|------|----------------|-------------|
| `upload_document` | `fileName`, `dataBase64`, `folder?`, `amount?` | Upload a PDF to the Yuki archive by passing its content as a base64 string. Use `get_document_folders` first to find the right folder ID. |
| `upload_document_from_path` | `filePath`, `fileName?`, `folder?`, `amount?` | Upload a PDF from a local file path. Reads and encodes the file internally — preferred over `upload_document` when the file is available on disk. Validates that the file exists and is a valid PDF before uploading. |
| `get_document_folders` | — | List all archive folders available in the administration. |
| `list_documents` | `folderId` | List documents in a specific archive folder. Returns document IDs, file names, dates, and amounts. |

| `download_document` | `documentId` | Download an archived document as a base64-encoded string. |
| `get_cost_categories` | — | List available GL cost categories for use as the `costCategory` parameter in upload tools. |

### Backoffice

| Tool | Key parameters | Description |
|------|----------------|-------------|
| `get_workflow` | `administrationId?` | Retrieve backoffice workflow items — documents that could not be processed automatically and are awaiting review by the accountant. |
| `get_outstanding_questions` | `administrationId?` | Retrieve outstanding questions raised by the accountant that require a response before the related documents can be processed. |

## Testing

### Option 1 — MCP Inspector (tool-level, no LLM)

```bash
npm run inspect
```

Opens a browser UI at `http://localhost:5173` where you can call individual tools and inspect raw responses.

### Option 2 — Agent test harness (with Claude)

Runs a full agentic loop: Claude reasons about the task, calls tools, and returns a final answer — exactly as an AI agent would use this MCP.

Add your Anthropic API key to `.env`:

```env
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

Then run a scenario:

```bash
npm run agent                                              # default: get_administrations
npm run agent -- --scenario outstanding-invoices
npm run agent -- --scenario search-relations --arg "Bedrijf BV"
npm run agent -- --scenario gl-accounts
npm run agent -- --scenario bank-transactions --arg "1200"
npm run agent -- --scenario full-workflow
```

Available scenarios: `get-administrations`, `search-relations`, `outstanding-invoices`, `outstanding-payables`, `gl-accounts`, `bank-transactions`, `full-workflow`.

```

### Auth flow

Yuki uses a two-step authentication pattern:

1. `Authenticate(accessKey)` → returns a temporary `sessionID`
2. All subsequent calls include that `sessionID`

`YukiClient.getSessionID(adminId?)` handles this transparently. When called with an `administrationId`, it resolves the matching API key from the loaded keys map. Session IDs are cached per API key for the lifetime of the process — `Authenticate` is only called once per key, not once per tool call.

> **Note:** Parameter casing differs across Yuki's services — `sessionId` (lowercase d) on `Sales.asmx` and `Purchase.asmx`; `sessionID` (uppercase D) on `Accounting.asmx`, `AccountingInfo.asmx`, `Contact.asmx`, and `Archive.asmx`. This is handled per-tool.

### XML documents

Write tools (`process_sales_invoice`, `process_purchase_invoice`, `process_journal`, `upsert_contact`) pass structured data to Yuki as an XML string inside the `xmlDoc` SOAP parameter. The `XmlValue` wrapper ensures this XML is embedded raw (not entity-encoded) in the SOAP envelope. All user-supplied values are XML-escaped via `escapeXml()`.

---

## Rate limits

Yuki enforces **1,000 API requests per day** (upgradeable to 5,000–10,000). Each tool call is 1 request. Session IDs are cached so `Authenticate` is only called once per API key per server process, not once per tool call.

Design agent workflows to fetch broad lists once and reference them from the agent's context window rather than re-fetching on every step.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Error | Likely cause |
|-------|-------------|
| `SOAP Fault: Authentication failed` | `YUKI_API_KEY` is incorrect or API access is not enabled in Yuki Settings |
| `No API key found for administration …` | The `administrationId` passed to the tool is not in the loaded keys file — check `YUKI_API_KEYS_FILE` |
| `SOAP Fault: Administration not found` | Wrong `administrationId` — run `get_administrations` to get the correct GUID |
| `Journal entries do not balance` | Amounts in `process_journal` don't sum to 0 — check debit/credit signs |
| `HTTP 500 from api.yukiworks.nl` | Usually a wrong XML namespace or malformed `xmlDoc` — check the WSDL at `https://api.yukiworks.nl/ws/{Service}.asmx?wsdl` |
| `File does not appear to be a PDF` | The file at `filePath` does not start with the `%PDF` magic bytes — check you're pointing at a valid PDF |
| `File not found` | `filePath` passed to `upload_document_from_path` does not exist or is inaccessible |
| `Network error` | No connectivity to `api.yukiworks.nl` — requests time out after 30 seconds |
